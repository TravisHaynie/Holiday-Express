# Module 11 Challenge: Note Taker

## Description
Note Taker is a command-line application built using Express.js that allows users to write, save, and delete notes. It uses an Express.js backend to handle API requests and interacts with a JSON file (db.json) to store and retrieve note data. The front end of the application is already provided, and this project focuses on building the back end to connect and manage the notes functionality.
